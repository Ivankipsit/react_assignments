Variables Assignment - 1	

Create a component Sample which accepts props (x, y, z) 
and has local variables [a,b,c]. 
a is defined with 'var', 
b is defined with 'let' and 
'c' with const. 
Assign (a,b,c) as (5,3,3). 
This sample component should return sum of (x+a, y+b, z+c) as 
output in H2 tag in the following format: 
(Example only) 
X+A is 6 Y+B is 3 Z+C is 4 
Call Sample component from App.js three times with following datasets 
for x,y,z 
(x,y,z) = (1,2,3) 
(x,y,z) = (5, 10, 3) 
(x,y,z) = (1,3,1)



Variables Assignment - 2	

Create a component Sample which accepts 3 props (a,b,c). 
De-structure the props and return sum of a+b+c inside H2 tag. 
Call Sample component from App component three times with different data.



Variables Assignment - 3	

Create the following components - (X, Y, Z). 
X should return sum of all props (a,b) 
Y should return sum of all props (a,b,c) 
Z is having 4 local variables (a1, b1, c1, d1) and returns sum of all local variables. 
Call X,Y and Z from App.js
